### 💻 Our Mission

We meet to share knowledge, swap stories of successful defenses (and maybe a few tales of digital 'shipwrecks'), and hone our skills in all things digital security.

* 🛡️ **Protect the Loot:** Discussing defense strategies, threat hunting, and security architecture.
* ⚔️ **Sharpen the Cutlass:** Learning new tools, techniques, and penetration testing methodologies (ethical hacking only, of course!).
* 🗺️ **Map the Waters:** Keeping up-to-date on the latest vulnerabilities, zero-days, and regulatory changes.

### ⏳ This Port is Under Construction

**Shiver me timbers!** This page is just the crow's nest. Our full website—complete with meeting schedules, member resources, and a treasure trove of past presentations—is currently being built with hardened steel and triple-encrypted cables.

#### **Expected Launch Date: Soon, before the Kraken rises!**

### A Word of Warning from the Quartermaster:

> "In the world of cyber, a locked treasure chest is only as good as the pirate who guards it. Keep your firewalls high, your passwords long, and never trust a strange parrot offering free loot."
